# Stock-analysis


This repository contains python scripts that I am devleoping to perform analysis on stock prices and visualization of stock prices and other data such as volume.

Some of the goals I want to achieve with this project include:

Get the data I need from Yahoo Finance or other API. Able to specify what I need and the time range.
Different regression implementations on the close price data. (Linear, SVM, etc.) 

Possibly try to fit a polynomial function which follows the data.

Predicting Stock price for the next day.
